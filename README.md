# ID-Card-Information-Extraction-from-Video-Frames
This project uses OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to extract ID card information (name, date of birth, contact details) from specific video frames. It processes frame ranges, identifies common text, and parses it for relevant details, with visual validation via Matplotlib. This approach is ideal for automated identity verification and data entry.
